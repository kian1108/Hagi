                    Did you know that Keanu Reeves is responsible for the film's name? Apparently, he would enthusiastically go around telling people he was working on a movie called “John Wick,” and he did it so much that they figured they might as well call the movie that instead of “Scorn.

                    The name was a shout out to a family member! John Wick is now synonymous with the character, but it is not necessarily the most gripping name on paper. It was not developed out of whole cloth by Kolstad but was instead an homage to his grandfather of the same name. Fortunately, his grandfather was flattered and especially liked his name being used for a hitman character

                    Some headwear was needed to cover up for an injury.
                    The late Michael Nyqvist, who plays the main villain Viggo Tarasov, was apparently a game performer. Have you noticed in John Wick that sometimes Viggo is wearing a hat, while other times he is not? There’s a practical reason for that. While filming a physical scene, Nyqvist’s head was accidentally split open. It was nasty enough to need stitches, which meant a wig couldn’t be used. It was Nyqvist’s idea to wear a hat from that point on in the film, so any scene where he wears a hat is post-injury.

                    Leitch has moved on but found success. While Leitch was technically considered a producer by the DGA on John Wick, he definitively was the co-director. However, for the sequels, Stahelski directed solo. However, Leitch is doing just fine. He made his solo directorial debut in 2017 with Atomic Blonde, a film starring Charlize Theron with a lot of John Wick vibes. Oh, he’s also directed Deadpool 2 and Hobbs & Shaw, two massive blockbusters.

                    John Wick has a notable, distinct tattoo on his back. It includes the Latin phrase “Fortis Fortuna Aduivat.” This translates roughly to “Fortune favors the strong.” It is a popular motto for military units all over the world. Of course, it wouldn’t be surprising if Wick had some military experience in his past.

                    Reeves did most of his stunts, even the dog-related ones. He had bacon grease on his face to prompt his dog to jump into bed to lick it. John Wick is a film filled with brutal violence and tragic revenge. Why not leave in the image of a dog licking Keanu Reeves’ face?

                    The duo of directors amped up the idea of John Wick as something of an urban legend. Other criminals and assassins speak of him in hushed tones and with nothing but respect and fear. The concept of Wick as a “Boogeyman” type figure came from the directors and was part of why Reeves was enthusiastic about having them on board.
